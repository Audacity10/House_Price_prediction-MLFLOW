# House_Price_prediction-MLFLOW

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model for house prices based on various features, such as square footage, number of rooms, and location. We utilize a Random Forest model due to its robust performance with tabular data and integrate MLflow for managing and tracking experiments, enabling efficient and organized workflow for model improvement.
